# Build Software for You

Not for an investor.
Not for a user base.
Not for scale.

Just for you.
Because you had an idea. Because something was missing. Because you could.

You shouldn’t need five APIs, two auth providers, and a YAML file you don’t understand — just to make something small and useful.

You shouldn’t need a startup plan.
Or a roadmap.
Or permission.

You should just be able to build.

Like grabbing a tool from your garage and getting to work.
Simple. Focused. Yours.

# A New Era for Personal Software

The tide is turning.

AI is lowering the barrier to entry.
And RedwoodSDK is cutting out the plumbing.

This isn’t about scale.
It’s about solving your own problems.
It’s about making something that works — without explaining it to a product manager.

You don’t need a business model.
You don’t need a cofounder.

You just need a reason to build.
And a framework that stays out of your way.

# RedwoodSDK v0.1

RedwoodSDK is a full-stack React framework built on top of Cloudflare’s global infrastructure.

We started Redwood to help developers build faster — to reduce friction and accelerate creation. But with v0.1, we’re going further.

We’re building the **toolkit for personal software.**

Software you can build, own, share, and modify (like it used to be).

Software that solves your problem — not someone else’s.

Software that doesn’t lock you in, track your usage, or upsell you.

Because the joy of writing software — and the joy of using it — should go hand in hand.

# **What’s Inside RedwoodSDK v0.1**

RedwoodSDK comes with all the infrastructure you need to build real-world apps — out of the box.

### **✅ [A Router That Reflects Reality](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/routing/)**

- A single config file — not tied to your file system
- Move files or folders freely — routes won’t break
- Add middleware or interrupters directly inline
- Models the **request → response** flow like the web does

### **✅ [React Server Components, Built In](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/react-server-components/)**

- Write async/await directly in your components
- Fetch from your database without creating an API endpoint
- No hydration, no client JS bundle
- Smaller, faster, and easier to reason about

### **✅ [Passkey Authentication + Durable Sessions](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/authentication/)**

- WebAuthn passkey auth works out of the box
- Sessions stored using **Cloudflare Durable Objects**
- Global, secure, and stateful
- No tokens, no cookies, no third-party dependencies

### **✅ [D1 Database, Already Wired Up](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/database/)**

- Works in dev with no config
- Prisma-compatible schema
- Deploys seamlessly to Cloudflare with your app

### **✅ [R2 Object Storage (File Uploads, Streamed)](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/storage/)**

- S3-compatible storage built into the platform
- Upload and download files as streams — no memory bloat
- Local dev support and seamless deployment

### **✅ [Cron Jobs](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/cron/) + [Queues](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/queues/)**

- Background processing built-in
- No external job runner required
- Run scheduled or deferred tasks without extra infrastructure

### **✅ [One-Command Deploy](https://docs.rwsdk.com/core/hosting/**

Want to go live? Just run:

```tsx
pnpm release
```

That’s it.

Your full app — frontend, backend, database, sessions, and storage — is deployed to the Cloudflare edge.

## **🌍 Built for the Real Web**

Most of our team is based in South Africa. That means we think a lot about latency, bandwidth, and infrastructure that works outside of Silicon Valley.

What’s good for rural South Africa is good for the world:

- Fast apps that don’t ship unnecessary JS
- Lightweight tools that work on unreliable connections
- Software that’s fast *because it’s simple*, not because it’s subsidized

## **🛠️ Get Started**

You can create a new RedwoodSDK app right now:

```tsx
npx create-rwsdk my-next-project
```

Start coding. Add features. Move fast.

Everything you need is already there.

## **🖥️ Software Should Be Yours Again**

RedwoodSDK isn’t just a framework — it’s a belief.

That software can be personal again.

Not just technically, but philosophically.

Owned. Forkable. Shareable. Local. Beautiful.

Built for use — not for scale.

Built with love — not venture funding.

Built for yourself — and maybe a few others.

If this resonates with you, come join us.

We’re not just building tools.

We’re building a future where software is yours again.
